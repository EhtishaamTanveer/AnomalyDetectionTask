# Anomaly Detection for Server Health Monitoring

### Description

This repository implements an anomaly detection algorithm to identify unusual behavior in server computer data.
It's designed to assist administrators in proactively detecting potential issues before they escalate into critical system failures.

I took the initiative to complete this task while continuing my Coursera certification on "[Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/NG3GPTVN7M8E?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=s12n)"

### Key Features

- Unlabeled Dataset Integration: Leverages a dataset of 307 server health samples (unlabeled) for effective anomaly detection.
- Algorithm Implementation: Gaussian estimation was implemented in combination with a threshold setup based on F1 score that separated the outliers from the normal data.
- Dimensionality: Anomaly Detection has been performed on a low dimensional dataset first (with fewer features) and then with a high dimensional dataset to observe how anomalies are detected

### Benefits

- Proactive Server Monitoring: Early detection of anomalous server behavior allows for swift intervention and minimizes downtime.
- Reduced Downtime: Identifying potential faults before they cause outages enhances system uptime and operational efficiency.
- Improved Resource Management: By focusing on anomalous events, server administrators can prioritize tasks and resource allocation effectively.
